      <h2>A bit about me.</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my personal website I made during Girls Who Code's
        accelerated Summer Immersion Program. This is an exciting opportunity
        for me to be able to share my website! Computer science and technology
        has been an interest of mine for several years, so I'm always looking
        for new experiences to expand my horizons.
      </p>
      <p>
        During school, I participate in CS classes and outside of class I'm on
        FRC robotics team #5572. When I'm not staying late after school, I enjoy
        yoga, creative writing, photography, and art. Volunteering is another
        big part of my life as well. I like to support organizations that
        support me, so I often volunteer at robotics competitions.
