My Asana Timer is for yogis around the world who struggle with keeping time or self-queuing. The simple, yet useful, app allows for the creation of up to ten unique sequences. Yogis are able to customize the name, length, and number of repetitions for each sequence so that any practice can utilize My Asana Timer. When one can't get to the studio or is stuck at home, My Asana Timer can remind you of when to start your next sequence or pose. With alert options including vibration and the sound of a Tibetan cymbal, yogis can create an experience all their own without disturbing their practice. Additionally, My Asana Timer features a soothing ambient soundtrack perfect for any practice, but the option can be turned off for those looking for a quiet session. Unlike other fitness timers, My Asana Timer is tailored to fit the needs of yoga practitioners and is a useful prop in any yogi's practice. My Asana Timer was developed for the MIT App Inventor Appathon 2020, where it received "Honorable Mention" in the youth individuals group.
